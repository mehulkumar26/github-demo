Despite their utility, STRs are particularly difficult to genotype. The repetitive sequence responsible for their high mutability also results in frequent alignment errors that can complicate and bias downstream analyses. In addition, PCR stutter errors often result in reads that contain additional or fewer repeat copies than the true underlying genotype.
