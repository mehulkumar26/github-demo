The impact of genomics is contingent upon its ability to identify genetic variants. While tremendous progress has been made in identifying nearly every type of genetic variation, short tandem repeat (STR) variations remain largely understudied. Composed of repeating 1–6 base pair motifs, STRs are among the most polymorphic variants in the human genome and are present at over 1 million loci. STRs play a key etiological role in more than 30 Mendelian disorders1 and recent evidence has underscored their profound regulatory role and potential involvement in complex traits2–4. Beyond medical genetics, STRs have applications in population genetics, forensics, and single cell lineage analysis. While several STR callers exist5, 6, they suffer from limited accuracy, difficulties in calling homopolymer runs, sensitivity to PCR stutter noise, and limited functionality compared to SNP callers. As a result, large-scale projects7–9 are reluctant to report STR genotypes and are essentially blind to many of the most variable parts of the genome.
